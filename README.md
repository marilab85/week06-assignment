Week 06 Assignment
Build a Responsive and Accesible Image Gallery

For this week's assignment I found it particularly difficult.
I got HTML and CSS way more easily, because they made sense faster.

I did understand JS and all the functions, but I haven't figured out how to make sense out of them yet.
When I get our shared code from last class, I follow what is happening, but once I try to create something from scratch, I realise I didn't understand afterall.

I get that over time it will be more efficient, but so far I am struggling a little bit. I learn by repetition, so, as long as it is new to me, it will take a minute for me to figure it out.

I even created "hanbdbooks" personalised to myself with language and examples that I understand better, using LLM. On them, I had sessions with most comon syntaxes and "formulas"(?), so I can reference back during class. I find it quite good for when Frankie asks questions, and I know where to look for them.
One thing I know I should be doing is to read the class plan beforehand, but I'm not finding the time to do it on the weekends so far. Will figure something out.

As far as this specific assignment, I put the effort I could, and used the class code to create something not too different, but at least I got an audio in there. I feel I need to see more JS to understand the sequences and logic behind it.

Thanks again for another grat week.
